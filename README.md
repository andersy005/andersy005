### Hello, it's me 👋


I’ve been extremely lucky to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to handle terabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud platforms.

<!--- 🔭 I’m currently working on [dask](https://github.com/dask), [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm), [pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch)-->


As part of my work at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), I contribute to multiple open-source projects such as dask, xarray, and intake.


### If the work I've ever done has positively impacted your work/organization, please consider sponsoring NumFOCUS through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/numfocus) or donating directly to [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate).

Santé 🥂 🍻
