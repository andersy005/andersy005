I‚Äôve been extremely lucky to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to (1) handle terabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud platforms and (2) move science forward.



As part of my work at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), I am a core developer of [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray)

As part of my work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, I am a core contributor to many projects in the PyData ecosystem, and in particular the following major projects:

- xarray -- an open source library providing high-level, easy-to-use data structures and analysis tools for working with multidimensional labeled datasets and arrays in Python.

  [Documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/)|[GitHub](https://github.com/pydata/xarray)|[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xarray)|[Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xarray)

- dask-mpi -- an open source library that makes it easy to deploy Dask from within an existing MPI environment, such as one created with the common MPI command-line launchers mpirun or mpiexec.

  [Documentation](http://mpi.dask.org/en/latest/)|[GitHub](https://github.com/dask/dask-mpi)|[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/dask-mpi)|[Conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dask-mpi)

- intake-esm ‚Äî- an intake plugin for working with Earth System Model catalogs
