I‚Äôve been extremely lucky to work in realms that allow me to cross institutional and geographic boundaries to collaborate on tools and research software. More generally I contribute to and maintain several libraries within the open source scientific Python stack, particularly around improving scalability of Python tools in order to (1) handle terabyte-scale datasets on HPC and cloud platforms and (2) move science forward.

<!--- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on [dask](https://github.com/dask), [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray), [intake-esm](https://github.com/intake/intake-esm), [pooch](https://github.com/fatiando/pooch)-->


As part of my work at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/), I contribute to multiple open-source projects such as `dask`, `xarray`, `jupyter`, and `intake`. These projects are part of [**NumFOCUS**](https://numfocus.org) organization. NumFocus serves as a fiscal umbrella for many open-source software projects that have become essential for science and research. 

If you are interested in sponsoring `dask`, `xarray`, `jupyter` generally, I would recommend you head over to the NumFOCUS [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/numfocus) page. You're welcome to donate to  [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/donate) directly of course.
